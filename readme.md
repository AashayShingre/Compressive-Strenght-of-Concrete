## Prediction of Compressive Strength

The data has 10 labeled relevant dependent parameters viz. **Binder Quantitiy (in Kg/m^3), fly-ash and slag (in ratio), rest period hours, curing temperature, curing period, NaOH/Na2SiO3 quantity, superplasticizer,  extra water added, molarity, alkaline activator/binder ratio** and an independent parameter '**Compressive Strengh (in MPa)**'

To get the data around 64 renowned research journals on the concerned topic were reviewed by my collegues at Civil Engineering Dept., and around 300 - 400 records were extracted.

Henceforth, we want to,
- Implement ANN to get more precise predictions.
- Check how this data stand against the UCI dataset which came from the single source and has ~1000 records.
